# MachineLearningExamples
This Repository is for data science and machine learning examples i have done.

# Prerequisites
You need to download Python Anaconda(Spyder, Jupyter Notebook) or you can just use Google Colaboratory ( i recommend this for beginners and those who wants a quick start with examples)

# Built With
Spyder - Anaconda 

Terminal

Description: A Chinese automobile company Teclov_chinese aspires to enter 
the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars 
locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. They have 
contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which 
the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors 
affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very 
different from the Chinese market.
